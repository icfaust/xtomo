A series of cameras for tomography on the Alcator C-Mod Tokamak (https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/95108/91ja002_full.pdf?sequence=1) required calibrated relative sensitivies
They were over 20 years old at the time, and the wear and tear to the system made the relative sensities questionable.
Using an Amptek XR-100 (http://amptek.com/products/xr-100cr-si-pin-x-ray-detector/) a series of data was taken with a known X-ray soure.
Differences in the transmission were caclulated, to see if the sensitivity change was due to a deposit on the foil.
Results showed that it was not the foil, but degredation in the amplifier circuit.
